			<h2>bio</h2>
			<p>drewv hails from a diverse musical upbringing that shines through his performances and productions. Although his background is rooted in classical music, his influences range from emo-pop punk, to hip hop, to house music. These influences are clearly evident within his performances and productions, whether that is rocking a high energy open-format club set, or evoking emotion through his productions.</p>
			<p>
			while drewv's reputation stems from his ability to cultivate vibes within a party scene, his original and remix productions have also amassed upwards of over a million plays online, though features as SmashTheClub.com and Electro Pose. Having been featured and interviewed across several online outlets across the globe, his most sucessful track had successfully trended on HYPEM. He continuously looks to evolve and incorporate his style and sound into his music works.
